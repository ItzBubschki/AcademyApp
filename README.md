# AcademyApp
This is the progressive web app made with react for the official Academy (not the one giving away Oscars lol).

This was my very first React project. I used this to learn React so keep that in mind while looking at the code.

The website can be visited at https://www.dieacademy.web.app

There are still a few things just in german but I'm currently working on i18n so just wait a little bit until it's fully available in english.
