# AcademyApp

This is the progressive web app made with react for the official Academy (not the one giving away Oscars lol).

This was my very first React project. I used this to learn React so keep that in mind while looking at the code.

The website can be visited at https://dieacademy.web.app/Home. It is hosted on Firebase.

The website is available in German and in English and it will change depending on your browser language. 

Although the laws themselves were written in German and won't be translated into English as it just isn't worth the effort. 

The website is meant for mobile devices but it should still look good on PC. (For optimal experience you can use the Browser devtools to view the page on a Smartphone)

Android users can also download the app from the play
store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ItzBubschki.AcademyApp).

Or you just add it to your Homescreen from your browser since it is a PWA.
