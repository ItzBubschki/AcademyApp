# AcademyApp

This is the progressive web app made with react for the official Academy (not the one giving away Oscars lol).

This was my very first React project. I used this to learn React so keep that in mind while looking at the code.

The website can be visited at https://dieacademy.web.app/Home. It is hosted on Firebase and will automatically deploy on
merges onto main

There are still a few things just in German, but I'm currently working on i18n so just wait a little until it's fully
available in english.

The website is meant for mobile devices is PC optimized.

Android users can also download the app from the play
store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ItzBubschki.AcademyApp).

Or you just add it to your Homescreen from your browser since it is a PWA.
